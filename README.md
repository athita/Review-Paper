# 2018 Paper
The early of the year, My professor assigned me to understand about Daegu Taxi data. Our data sets have many fields of a air pollution, fine dust, engine. So, first of all I try to read paper about "Air pollution first".

## Pollution
1. A Study for Spatial Distribution of Principal Pollutants in Daegu Area Using Air Pollution Monitoring Network Data [한국어]
2. Characteristics of roadside air pollution in Korean metropolitan city (Daegu) over last 5 to 6 years: Temporal variations, standard exceedances, and dependence on meteorological conditions
3. A study of horizontal distribution pattern of particulate and gaseous pollutants based on ambient monitoring near a busy highway
4. Mobile monitoring for mapping spatial variation in urban air quality: development and validation of a methodology based on an extensive dataset
5. Impact of traffic flows and wind directions on air pollution concentrations in Seoul, Korea

## MonitoringPollution
1. The future of European urban air quality monitoring
2. Contextual Sensing: Integrating Contextual Information with Human and Technical Geo-Sensor Information for Smart Cities
3. Correlations between short-term mobile monitoring and long-term passive sampler measurements of traffic-related air pollution
4. Opportunistic mobile air pollution monitoring: A case study with city wardens in Antwerp
5. Mobile monitoring of particulate matter: State of art and perspectives
6. A novel mobile monitoring approach to characterize spatial and temporal variation in traffic-related air pollutants in an urban community
7. Mobile monitoring for mapping spatial variation in urban air quality: Development and validation of a methodology based on an extensive dataset
