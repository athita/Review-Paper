# 2018 Paper
The early of the year, My professor assigned me to understand about Daegu Taxi data. Our data sets have many fields of a air pollution, fine dust, engine. So, first of all I try to read paper about "Air pollution first".

## Pollution
1. A Study for Spatial Distribution of Principal Pollutants in Daegu Area Using Air Pollution Monitoring Network Data [한국어]
2. Characteristics of roadside air pollution in Korean metropolitan city (Daegu) over last 5 to 6 years: Temporal variations, standard exceedances, and dependence on meteorological conditions
3. A study of horizontal distribution pattern of particulate and gaseous pollutants based on ambient monitoring near a busy highway
4. Mobile monitoring for mapping spatial variation in urban air quality: development and validation of a methodology based on an extensive dataset
5. Impact of traffic flows and wind directions on air pollution concentrations in Seoul, Korea

## MonitoringPollution
1. The future of European urban air quality monitoring
2. Contextual Sensing: Integrating Contextual Information with Human and Technical Geo-Sensor Information for Smart Cities
3. Correlations between short-term mobile monitoring and long-term passive sampler measurements of traffic-related air pollution
4. Opportunistic mobile air pollution monitoring: A case study with city wardens in Antwerp
5. Mobile monitoring of particulate matter: State of art and perspectives
6. A novel mobile monitoring approach to characterize spatial and temporal variation in traffic-related air pollutants in an urban community
7. Mobile monitoring for mapping spatial variation in urban air quality: Development and validation of a methodology based on an extensive dataset

## OSM
1. Comparison of the accuracy of OpenStreetMap for Ireland with Google Maps and Bing Maps
2. Automated identification and characterization of parcels (AICP) with OpenStreetMap and Points of Interest
3. Citizens as sensors: the world of volunteered geography
4. Comparison of Volunteered Geographic Information Data Contributions and Community Development for Selected World Regions
5. High Resolution Air Pollution Maps in Urban Environments Using Mobile Sensor Networks
6. Mobile technologies and personalized environmental information for supporting sustainable mobility in Oslo: The Citi-Sense-MOB approach
7. Quantitative Comparison of Open-Source Data for Fine-Grain Mapping of Land Use

## VisualizationData
1. Towards Big Data Visualization for Monitoring and Diagnostics of High Volume Semiconductor Manufacturing
2. Data Visualization: Enhancing Big Data More Adaptable and Valuable
3. Big Data Visualization Tools
4. Design and Redesign in Data Visualization
5. Learning Visual Importance for Graphic Designs and Data Visualizations
6. Overview of Data Exploration Techniques
7. PPT-Data_Visualization_101_How_to_Design_Charts_and_Graphs
